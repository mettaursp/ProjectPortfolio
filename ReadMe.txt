Each directory contains a portfolio of projects for different types of projects.
Instructions tailored for each type of project have been put in ReadMe files in each
category's directory, and each project will have its own ReadMe to describe its purpose
and how to use it.

My programming style is constantly evolving so each of these projects will be a snapshot
of my programming style at the time of the last edit. Some of these projects are actively
being worked on so shortcomings in style or architecture may be refined in future commits.
I don't always have time to refactor, but I am very critical of my own code so there is
a good chance that I know about style and architectural issues and have made time to
revise the code later. All of the code that makes it to this repository will have been
edited, trimmed, and refactored several, if not dozens of times over. Not everything will
be perfect, but I strive to make my code the best that I can.

If you have any criticisms or suggestions and would like to voice them to me, please send
them to me at trevorb309@gmail.com ! I'll gladly take feedback because peer reviews and
professional interactions are what made me the programmer I am today.
